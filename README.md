# FT_TRANSCENDENCE
First full-stack web application in nestjs and react.

This is a group project, we had to build an application with which we could:
- authenticate using the school's oauth system
- modify our profile (photo, name...)
- add friends
- use a chat with private groups and public groups
- send direct messages
- block users
- temporarily mute or ban users if you are the admin of a channel
- play a game of pong with other users
- watch a match played by other users
and some others features.

You can't run this app without the .env but here is some images of what you could find on our application.
